[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/rx-when.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/rx-when/)

[rxjs](http//reactivex.io/rxjs/) 'if-then-else' operator,
shorthand for partition/merge, for more fluid, slightly less cluttered code:
```ts
import when from 'rx-when' // default export can be renamed to 'ifThenElse'...
import { interval } from 'rxjs/observable/interval'
import { map, take } from 'rxjs/operators'

interval(1000).pipe(
  take(5),
  when(v => !(v % 2))(
    map(v => `${v} is even`), // 'then' operator
    map(v => `${v} is odd`) // 'else' operator, optional
  )
)
.subscribe(debug('next:'), debug('error:'), debug('done'))
```

instead of:
```ts
import { merge } from 'rxjs/observable/merge'
import { interval } from 'rxjs/observable/interval'
import { map, partition, take } from 'rxjs/operators'

const source$ = interval(1000).pipe(take(5))
const [ even$, odd$ ] = partition(v => !(v % 2))(source$)
merge(
  map(v => `${v} is even`)(even$),
  map(v => `${v} is odd`)(odd$)
)
.subscribe(debug('next:'), debug('error:'), debug('done'))
```

# API
```ts
declare function when<I, O>(predicate: (v: I) => boolean): (
  onTrue: RxOperator<I, O>,
  onFalse?: RxOperator<I, O> // default to identity function
) => RxOperator<I, O>

type RxOperator<I,O> = ($: Observable<I>) => Observable<O>
```
the `when` operator splits the input stream according to a predicate,
processes the partitioned streams
with the corresponding operators (`onTrue` and `onFalse`),
and merges both resulting streams back into a single output stream.

the `onFalse` operator is optional,
defaults to the identity function that leaves the stream as is.

note that since the `when` operator is this module's default export,
it can easily be renamed to anything else, e.g. `ifThenElse`.

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
